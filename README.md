# pushup-counter
Push up counter is a python3.10-based project using Google's built-in module media pipe and python module open cv to detect shoulder and elbow angles and give a list containing frequently changing the position of nodes of elbow and shoulder angles. if the person is in front of the webcam then this program detects from the user's input if he's doing the pushup or not. If angles nodes not changing(not any person in front of cam) then the program shows nothing. if anyone is in a pushup position then the program detects their angle nodes and starts calculating his/her pushup. This program also tells the user if he/she doing pushups right or not.
